<h3><a name="correlation-approximation" class="anchor" href="#correlation-approximation"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link"></span></a> Correlation Approximation</h3>
<p>The correlation approximation engine is a spark-based implementation of the more well known Google Correlate. </p>
<p>When analyzing a new time series you may want to compare it against a bank of existing time series data to discover possible relationships in the data. </p>
<img src="/correlation-approximation/img/data.png"/>
<p>Direct comparison of your time series against each series in the bank may work for small or moderate size datasets, but with large data sets and long vectors the operation could
    take longer than a user is willing to wait. By using a scalable approximation technique you can answer these types of correlation queries on huge sets of data very quickly.</p>
