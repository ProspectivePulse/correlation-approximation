<h3><a name="note" class="anchor" href="#note"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Note</h3>
<p>Our examples are built and tested on Cloudera cdh5.0.0. Spark and Hadoop are installed and setup on our cluster using Cloudera Manager. We recommend using the Cloudera
    distribution of spark and Hadoop to simplify your cluster management but any compatible versions of Spark and Hadoop should work.</p>
<p>To build Spark for other Hadoop versions see the Spark documentation.</p>
<p>
    If you use a different version of spark or hadoop you will have to modify the build.gradle script accordingly. Depending on your version of spark you may need to include a
    dependency on hadoop-client.
